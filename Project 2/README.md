# Project 2 - Data Visualization

## Overview
Create a piece of code that visualizes any data set in a meaningful way. This can be a piece of live data or information taken from an API, or it can be a data set you have downloaded. Be creative, try and get away from basic charts or maps and represent your data in an interesting, informative, and unique way. Pick a data set that is meaningful to you, and share that information with your audience.

## Conception & Implementation

Conceptually I wanted my visualization to come across more ambiguous and less representational in the realistic sense of data visualization. Each torus represents a different country with their colour and speed being directly influenced by where they score on the world happiness index. Directly pulling from the project details the notion of straying away from traditional charts or maps to represent it in an interesting, informative, and unique way. I wanted the viewer to have their own interpretation on the piece that I created without simply giving all the information directly to the viewer, only fully understanding the idea after it was explained to them. 

I played around with the idea of incorporating a better signifer for the data points represented within my code by creating text objects for each country but due to 3D rendering constraints it caused my file to completely stall and almost crash my web browser.

The main inspiration for this project was centered around the aesthetics of weirdcore.
